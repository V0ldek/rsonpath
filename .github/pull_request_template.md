## README

_Please remove this section before posting the PR._

_You need to tick all the items outlined in the **checklist** or the PR will likely be rejected.
Any exceptions need to be justified. If you fail to meet these criteria, consider a draft PR._

_PRs should have an associated issue that was triaged and
accepted, i.e. assigned the <span style="color: #FF4400">acceptance: go ahead</span>
label. Only cosmetic PRs are exempt from this rule, i.e._

- _Minor dependency bumps._
- _Minor documentation tweaks._
- _Minor refactorings._

_In those cases, remove the **Issue** section and replace it with a justification._
