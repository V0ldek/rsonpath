# Who is this book for?

The book is divided into three parts, each targeted at a different audience.

1. [**Part I -- CLI User Guide**](/user/intro.md) is aimed at users of `rq`.
It covers installation and basic usage, JSONPath query language reference,
and advanced tips and tricks on juicing every last bit of performance
out of `rq`.

2. [**Part II -- Library User Guide**](/lib/intro.md) is aimed at developers looking to utilize
`rsonpath-lib` in their projects. It contains an overview of the API surface
and a breakdown of all configuration knobs that can be tuned for performance.

3. [**Part III -- Developer Guide**](/dev/intro.md) is aimed at developers looking to contribute
to `rsonpath`. It goes into the nitty-gritty details of the codebase, but
should still be relatively broad and approachable.

Regardless of which category of users you fall into, you need to understand JSONPath queries.
We describe the semantics in [JSONPath Reference](/user/usage/jsonpath.md).
