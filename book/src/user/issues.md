# Reporting issues

The `rsonpath` project is under active development.
However, we have _very_ limited resources that can be spent on it,
so user feedback is crucial to make us aware of issues and decide
how to prioritize them.

## Bugs

If you find a bug, report it with our
[bug report form](https://github.com/V0ldek/rsonpath/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+bug&projects=&template=bug_report.yml)
on GitHub.

The most important part of a bug report is an MRE &ndash; Minimal Reproducible Example.
For `rsonpath` this is usually the query, and the JSON document that causes the bug.
You might not be possible to publish the actual document due to licensing
or non-disclosure agreements, but it is often possible to narrow down the issue
and publish a small, anonymized example, where keys in the query _and_ the document
are replaced with different, meaningless values.

## New features/enhancements

If there is a particular feature you really need,
or maybe a query that takes too long and we could optimize against,
you should [create an issue](https://github.com/V0ldek/rsonpath/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+feature&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=)
and let us know.

If there is an issue already open related to your problem,
comment or upvote that issue to let us know to prioritize that!
It's a small thing, but really helpful.

## Security vulnerabilities

Security vulnerabilities follow a separate flow, using GitHub's private reporting
system. Consult [Privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) to learn how to open a report.
